# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
Only the latest `main` is supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please do NOT open public issues for security problems.
Instead, contact the maintainers privately (recommended: GitHub Security Advisories if enabled), or create a private report via your preferred channel.

We will respond as soon as possible and coordinate a fix and disclosure.
